# 1. Even or Odd Checker
# Write a program that takes an integer as input and checks whether it is even or odd.
# Sample Input: 7
# Sample Output: 7 is odd
number = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
if number % 2 == 0:
    print(number, "is even")
else:
    print(number, "is odd")

# 2. Positive, Negative, or Zero
# Ask the user to enter a number and print whether it is positive, negative, or zero.
# Sample Input: -5
# Sample Output: The number is negative
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if number > 0:
    print("The number is positive")
elif number < 0:
    print("The number is negative") 
else:
    print("The number is zero")
    


# 4. Greatest of Two Numbers
# Take two numbers from the user and print which one is greater. If both are equal, print “Both are equal.”
# Sample Input: 10, 20
# Sample Output: 20 is greater
a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))

if a > b:
    print(a, "is greater")
elif b > a:
    print(b, "is greater")
else:
    print("Both are equal")

# 5. Check for Leap Year
# Take a year as input and check if it's a leap year.

# A year is leap if:

# divisible by 4 and

# not divisible by 100 unless also divisible by 400.
# Sample Input: 2020
# Sample Output: 2020 is a leap year
year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

#Day 3 assignment 
#1.Grade Calculator
# Ask the user to enter marks (0–100) and print the grade:
